# House of Games (frontend)

## Purpose
The goal of this frontend project was to build a interface that allows users to visualise and interact with the House of Games API (found [here](https://github.com/code-emad/House-of-Games)). 

The application allows users to view a reddit like site where users can view reviews of board games. The user can upvote/downvote at the press of a button, view comments attached, add a new comment to the review, delete a comment, filter reviews by category and sort by date/comment count/vote count. Further functionality is be added a later date. 

A link to the project can be found [here](https://emads-first-fe-proj-houseofgames.netlify.app/). Please note that at present minimal styling has been completed as the main focus has been functionality.
